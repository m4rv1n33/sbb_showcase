## 📖 Background
This project reflects my personal passion for trains and the Swiss railway system.  
As someone fascinated by the variety of rolling stock operated by SBB, I wanted to create a digital showcase that highlights their unique designs and roles in the network.  
From the sleek **Giruno** that connects Switzerland to Italy at high speed, to the versatile **RABe 511 KISS** that powers the Zürich S-Bahn, and the **FLIRT** serving regional routes across the country. Each train tells part of the story of Swiss mobility.
